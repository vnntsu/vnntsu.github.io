    I was asked to update an existing iOS apps to the latest version of iOS and to fix any issues caused by this as well as a few other existing issues. 
    This project had a very tight time scale and I was able to complete it in very good time while providing regular updates to the client.

    During my time at AT I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration workflow using tools such as Jenkins and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most of our software using Symfony, Backbone, Marionette, Vue and Vuex.

    For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over 600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using Symfony to provide a backend API and Backbone for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with Elasticsearch to provide search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

    Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company’s devOps, this included managing our AWS infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spend time configuring and maintaining our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using AD FS, Shibboleth and CAS but also maintaining our software’s SSO functionality.
