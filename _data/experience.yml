    I was asked to update an existing iOS apps to the latest version of iOS and to fix any issues caused by this as well as a few other existing issues. 
    This projects had a very tight time scale and I was able to complete it in very good time while providing regular updates to the client.

    In that time, I had to handle and build a few projects from zero like a Project Manager.

    I also learnt some new tech skills related to <mark>Back-end Web</mark>, Machine Learning, Data Science, etc.

    I started working for Enclave company full-time during my fourth year at University. 
    It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over the past 3 years.
